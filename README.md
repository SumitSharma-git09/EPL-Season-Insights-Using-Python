# ⚽ EPL Season Data Analysis Using Python

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing **data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization** on an English Premier League (EPL) season dataset using Python and its data analysis libraries in Jupyter Notebook.

The primary objective of this project is to extract meaningful insights from raw football statistics data by applying data preprocessing techniques and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
